The solution involves restructuring the component hierarchy or using an alternative method for navigating. For example, if you need to navigate from a component that's not a page, you could pass a navigation function down as a prop:

```javascript
// fixedCode.js
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation';

function MyComponent() {
  const router = useRouter();

  const handleClick = () => {
    router.push('/about');
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>Go to About</button>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

If this is not possible or ideal, you would need to find an alternate method for performing the navigation.  One way to solve this is by moving the navigation logic to a parent component that is within the page directory.

```javascript
// brokenCode.js
//Illustrates the problem: useRouter in a component outside page context
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation';

function MyComponent() {
  const router = useRouter(); //This will likely not work as expected outside of a page component

  const handleClick = () => {
    router.push('/about');
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>Go to About</button>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```
