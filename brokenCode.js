In Next.js 15, the use of `next/navigation`'s `useRouter` hook within a component that's not directly a page or a page component can lead to unexpected behavior.  This occurs because the `useRouter` hook relies on the routing context provided by the `pages` directory structure, and components outside this structure might not have access to the complete context. This is an uncommon error because the official documentation focuses primarily on page-level routing, and its behavior outside of the page context is not readily apparent.
